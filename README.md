# Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch Nanodegree

In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application. I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers among 102 flower categories using Pytorch. I build my classifier on top of the pertained model vgg16 (Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition.) The model reached 91% accuracy on the development set and 87% accuracy on the test set. The model can be imporved if larger pre-trained models were used such as DenseNet.
